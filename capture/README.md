# What is capture
Have you ever found yourself performing the same tasks in your terminal over and over? Automating that wasted effort is what capture is designed to do. With capture, you can write scripts by using your shell as you normally would, while copying your steps to a script procedurally.

# How capture works
When you run capture, you're starting a new shell. Capture acts as a middleman, giving the shell and itself the commands. Then, when you exit from capture, it writes everything you taught it during your session into a script, and automatically makes it executable. Simple! No messing with histfiles.

# Installation
Once this project is in full working order, you will be able to just type "make install". Capture will remain vaporware for a while longer, however.
