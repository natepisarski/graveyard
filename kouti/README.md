# kouti 
Kouti is a program that facilitates loose coupling of binary modules (literally programs). It allows you to use existing programs to define parts of a greater whole. Once kouti actually works, a tutorial will be written to describe exactly what that means.

# Status
Kouti is VERY MUCH in development. It is not nearly in a usable state. For right now, it's a skeleton of what the actual project will be.

# Future program specification
kouti server
kouti feed {other program} program [args]
kouti hook card program args
