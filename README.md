# graveyard
We all have projects that didn't work out for some reason. Maybe you lost interest, maybe there was a fatal design flaw. Whatever the reason, when it happens to me, it will go in this repository.

Take whatever you want from this project, and use it in whatever manor you see fit.

## Rules for graveyard
These are generalizations, not laws. In general:
* The programs here will compile, or run without any obvious syntax errors (if an interpreted language is used)
* The program is probably outdated
* The program probably has existing bugs that were never overcome

# Bonepit
The "Bonepit" is for random chunks of code I don't want anywhere else anymore. It could literally be anything, and it probably doesn't do anything useful or compile. It's like my Github's version of the `Lost+Found` folder in Linux systems.
