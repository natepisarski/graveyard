# graveyard
Here lie all of my promising young projects, cut short by either a fatal flaw in design or just a lack of caring from the developer. If, for whatever reason, parts from these programs are useful to you, you can have them. All of the code should be licensed under the 3-clause BSD license, so take what you will.

## Rules for graveyard
For me to move a project to graveyard, some things have to hold true:
* The program compiles
* The program doesn't work any longer, or is too buggy to have its own repository
For any code that doesn't meet those guidelines, it'll be thrown into the bone pit. Nothing there is guaranteed to work.
