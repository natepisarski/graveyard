# Cookbook-app
Cookbook-app is a plan to port Cookbook functionality to a binary namespace. Applications directly correlating to the functions found in Cookbook, but with command-line arguments instead of parameters, will appear here. The "Cookbook" program will call programs by short name, long name, or namespace path. This hypothetical program will use a Quill database.
